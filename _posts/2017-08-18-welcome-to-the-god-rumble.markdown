## A space for thinking
My name is Matthew and I am currently a student of theology (although I expect to be for the rest of my life!). I wanted to create a space where I would be able to document some of the things that I am thinking about concerning God, and I invite anyone and everyone to read. The content will not necessarily be autobiographical, at times it may seem highly theoretical, but as a theology student I believe that the big questions, as well as the small, matter. In fact my worldview says that how we answer the big questions in life often filter down into the micro level interactions of life. I am trying to get comments up and running, so when they are please feel free to engage and ask questions or make observations and give an opinion. Please be respectful of other users. Comments are powered by a popular third party platform called Disqus.
