## The crisis:
About six months ago I found myself praying a prayer. This in itself is not unusual as I have been a Christian and had a faith in God since I was about fifteen. What was perhaps a little unusual was the content of this particular prayer. “Lord,” I said, “I would one day love to be able to preach the gospel.” For someone who has known God and claimed to believe “the gospel” at least to some extent over the past twelve years, I found this an odd prayer to be praying. The more I thought about this prayer, the more questions began to arise. For example:
- What is “the gospel” that I have believed?
- Am I motivated to articulate it to others?
- If so, how would I articulate it?

These questions have been swirling in my head and I have found myself thinking about all sorts of things. What is God really like? What did Jesus achieve on the cross? Why does the apostle Paul consider the resurrection to be essential to the Christian hope? Why doesn’t everyone get to benefit from Christ’s act? What is saving faith? Is there a hell and if so why? Which version of the atonement is correct?

## A journey
This crisis, by the way, is not the kind that has sent me into despair. Instead I am excited to set out on a journey. The goal of this journey is just as I communicated through my prayer to God - I want to be able to communicate the gospel; to preach and proclaim it. But this is hard to do when I am not even fully certain what exactly it is. If someone were to come up to me today and ask me what it is I believe, I know there would be certain things that I could say. Perhaps it would include some elements like the goodness of God and His willingness to make a way for humanity to be reconciled to Him. But what about the parts that are not so palatable, such as me being a sinner and destined for hell if I were to be without Jesus. Would I be comfortable with sharing that with the person with an interest in my beliefs? My starting point is this: I know that if I could grasp even a portion of what it is I have believed, that just as it did for the early Christians, it would take over my life and I would never be the same.
Now, part of this has been actualised in my life already. I have tasted of the life changing power of the age to come, however, there must be more.  “More” is a word that gets used a lot in certain traditions of the church that include my own; but I am not sure that I even have the basics down let alone being capable of handling anything “more”! This isn’t a criticism of this type of language though, in fact I think it accurately expresses one of the only proper reactions to God’s grace. Once we taste of it we just can’t get enough.
## A plan
Each week I will be using this blogging space to document some of the elements of the journey that I have been on with learning to articulate the gospel.
